# Hi ðŸ«¡

My first neural network project following [Victor Zhou's blog post](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/)

## Goals

-   Learn how to build a neural network
-   Expand upon this...

### Dumb Takeaway/s

-   I always thought hidden layer meant we aren't weren't aware of what the values were in the layers. Maybe I was conflacting deep neural networks, black boxes, and neural networks in general?
